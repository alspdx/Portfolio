# Portfolio Website

#### First independent project for Epicodus Intro To Programming, 10.13.17

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Description

This website thoroughly demonstrates the concepts learned during the first week of Intro To Programming at Epicodus. The HTML file will show proper indentation and spacing, as well as an understanding of how to setup the HTML file and use HTML element tags like _p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div,_ and _span_. There is a custom CSS stylesheet, as well as a Bootstrap stylesheet to add Bootstrap functionality to the website. The website has links to other websites I've built with partners in class during this last week.
